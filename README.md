# BI_360

🚀 It's the inaugural Power BI guided project from my Codebasic boot camp journey. 🎓 This hands-on experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding of Power BI software and allowed me to refine my expertise in the FMCG sector. 

Throughout this project, I delved into diverse company divisions including Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain. This exploration illuminated their respective processes and vital reports.  📊📈

🏦 **Company Overview**
AtliQ Hardware is an electronic manufacturing company which is selling many types of hardware products to multiple customers in different countries. They are operating their business through different types of channels like Retailers, Distributors, and Direct through 2 platforms i.e. brick and mortar stores and e-commerce. The company has a significant market share in this product segment in all countries.

As a rapidly growing company, AtliQ Hardware was facing the challenge of efficiently collecting and analyzing data from diverse sources such as SQL databases, Excel sheets, and CSV files. 

These hurdles were potentially impeding their ability to make informed business decisions for sustained expansion and take timely corrective actions. 

Stepping in as a dedicated data analyst, I took on the mission to revolutionize the data landscape and pave the way for enhanced decision-making processes. 

🔍 **Project Overview: Empowering Data-Driven Decisions**

In my role, I meticulously orchestrated a comprehensive solution that spanned across various departments, including Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain. The project’s objectives were clear:

🎯 **Project Charter Implementation**
I harnessed the power of a well-structured Project Charter to guide our efforts, ensuring alignment, scope definition, and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.

📈 **Benchmark-Backed Data Validation**
In this project I extracted and transformed data with more than 1 million rows and learned the art of validating data as per the company's benchmarks, enabling us to maintain the highest data quality standards. 

🔄 **Data Modeling Excellence**
Utilizing Star and Snowflake Schema methodologies, I designed robust data models of more than 10 tables that formed the backbone of our analytics platform. I clearly differentiated between fact and dimension tables for enhanced clarity.

💡 **Transforming Data with Power Query**
Leveraging Power Query, I seamlessly transformed raw data into meaningful insights, ensuring our team had the right information at their fingertips.

📊 **Optimized Reports for Seamless Insights**
I delved into the intricacies of report optimization, reducing file sizes and enhancing user experiences for smoother navigation.

🎯 **Stakeholder Mapping Analysis**
I conducted a comprehensive Stakeholder Mapping Analysis to identify and categorize key stakeholders involved in the project. This analysis allowed me to visually represent their levels of influence, interest, and potential impact on the project's success, enabling more effective communication and tailored engagement strategies.

💰 **Finance Insights Unveiled**
For the Finance department, I engineered a dynamic P&L table structure using DAX, providing a comprehensive financial overview. Dynamic DAX queries enabled the creation of slicers like Quaters, YTD/YTG, and CY/LY for flexible data filtering.

📊 **Sales Performance Redefined**
Sales were given a new dimension with dynamic Performance Matrix visuals with GM% & NS$ Trends through Tooltips, alongside Customer, Product Performance, and Unit Economics insights.

📣 **Marketing Analytics at its Best**
The Marketing team gained valuable insights through carefully crafted visuals and also using bookmarks to create a Toggle button to switch between two visuals, allowing them to make strategic decisions based on data trends.

📦 **Supply Chain Visibility Achieved**
Supply Chain reports will help executives keep an eye on Inventory Forecasts and Net Error and take corrective measures if needed.

👨‍💼 **Executive Dashboard**
KPI visuals with detailed data matrix offered executives a clear view of operational performance with their market share data and enabled informed decision-making.

📊 **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Mastery**
Conceptualizing and executing UAT reports ensured our solutions were rigorously tested and aligned with user needs.

🚀 **Unleashing the Power of Power BI Services**
I guided the team through the realm of Power BI Services, including report sharing, Apps, and automatic data refresh, enabling real-time insights.

It's been an exhilarating journey of empowering AtliQ Hardware with data-driven insights. As we move forward, I'm excited to see the positive impact these insights will have on the company's growth trajectory. Here's to smarter decisions and a brighter future! 📈🔗
